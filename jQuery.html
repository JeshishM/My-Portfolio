  <h3 class="mybodytext">What is Nepal famous for?</h3>
  <div>
     <h2>Mountains</h2>
			<p>
				The country on the southern slopes of the Himalayas is home to eight of the world's ten highest peaks, including 	Mount Everest (8,848m; on the border between Nepal and Tibet), Lhotse (8,516 m; on the border between Tibet and Nepal), Makalu (8,463 m; on the border between Nepal and Tibet) and Kanchenjunga (8,586 m; on the border with Sikkim, India).Dhaulagiri, at 8,167 meters, is the highest mountain located within the borders of one country.	
			</p>
			<h2>Rivers</h2>

			</p>

				Swayambhunath, the ancient religious complex atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, west of Kathmandu.

  <h3 class="mybodytext">Things to do</h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <h2>EAT ALL THE DELICIOUS NEPALI FOOD</h2>
			<p> Don’t be worried by the quality or variety of food in Nepal because it’s incredibly good! Nom. </p>

				<p>For the local variety of snacks, start with Momos. The Nepali answer to dumplings, these pockets of joy come in vegetable, buff (buffalo) or chicken and can be fried or steamed. Our personal preference is steamed, served with a red chilli chutney.</p>

				<P>You can also find amazing Indian influences, such as pakora and samosas on any street corner! Next, find yourself some Choila, spicy grilled buffalo meat which goes down a treat with an ice cold Everest lager.</P>

				<p>For larger meals, you really can’t go past Dal Bhat, the Nepali staple meal for lunch and dinner. Dal Bhat is a traditional Nepali meal consisting of rice, a lentil based soup and other condiments, and it’s generally all you can eat so you’ll never go hungry. For those who enjoy soups, our go-to favourite is Thukpa or Thenthuk, a delicious mix of meat, noodles and vegetables in a thick soup, from the mountains of Tibet.</p>

				<p>On the restaurant front, check out Yangling just outside of Thamel. It has the best Tibetan/Nepali cuisine in all of Kathmandu (we’ve tried almost everywhere!), at seriously cheap prices.</p>

				<h2>EXPERIENCE NEPAL’S BEST TREKS AMONGST THE GLORIOUS HIMALAYAN MOUNTAINS</h2>
				<p> Trekking in Nepal is without a doubt one of the greatest things to do, anywhere in the world.</p>

				<p>There’s something about walking in Nepal that puts the mind and body at ease - it may be the sense of scale and perspective that only the Himalayas can give. Or perhaps it’s the fresh air, filtered by the surrounding forests and powerful winds. </p>

				<p>Or possibly it’s the trails lined with fluttering prayer flags, the constant call of ‘Namaste’, or the warm smiles offered by locals. </p>

				<p>Whatever it is, trekking is is one of the top things to do in Nepal, and you shouldn’t think of leaving this nation without having stepped foot on their mountain paths.</p>

				<p>Nepal has a huge array of trekking opportunities, of which we’ve listed our favourite (and our suggested) hikes below:</p>
				<h2>Some of the places to visit</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>EVEREST BASE CAMP</li>
					<li>MANANG</li>
					<li>MUSTANG</li>
					<li>ANNAPURNA BASE CAMP</li>
					<li>BAGLUNG: BUNGY JUMPING AND SWING</li>
					<li>POKHARA</li>
					<li>RARA LAKE</li>
